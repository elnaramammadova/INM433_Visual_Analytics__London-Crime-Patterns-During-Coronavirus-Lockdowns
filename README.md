Abstract—While Covid-19 lockdown measures imposed wide range of economic and social effects on society, crimes have shown unprecendented patterns in urban cities. Understanding how crime patterns evolved during stay-at-home measures might provide crucial insights into anticipating future crime trends. Even though lockdown measures led to sudden change in daily lives and better handling of pandemic, it is still unclear how they effected crime trends. This study provides exploratory spatial and temporal analysis of Lodon crimes before and after the nationwide lockdowns, which combines several visualization tools and cluster analysis. The study was carried out on dataset obtained from Metropolitan Police Service and City of London Police, in conjuction with Google mobility data and Covid-19 restriction timelines. This study attempts to find crime patterns in Greater London Region during stay-at-home measures, through space and time. Additionally, partition-based and hierarchical clustering methods were evaluated on their ability to facilitate the interpretation of crime patterns previously discovered through visual analytics.
